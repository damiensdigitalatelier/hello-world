# â§» ð“€ž ð“€Ÿ ð“€  ð“€¡ ð“€¤ ð“‚‰ Welcome to my world.

For all my life, I've been a "techno-leech," a digital sponge, soaking up the internet's many wonders. But it wasn't until recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, that I opened up to my interests in earnest and began learning the requisite skills to succeed online.

A life-long artist, I played bass in a couple of professional touring bands before my body became too old, fat and sore to sling a 3.86-kilogram instrument around my shoulders and jump around like someone who would rather drive around the continent in (at best) a modest tour bus that was never as nice as one would hope. (In the worst-case scenario, we'd be stuffed into a regular van, which provided the same pungent experience you would expect from a 1999 Ford Transit previously owned by a series of criminal degenerates.) I then moved on to my other artistic love, writing, which I pursued through the world of journalism.

It's an ugly industry, but Hunter S. Thompson described it best:

> "Journalism is not a profession or a trade. It is a cheap catch-all for fuckoffs and misfitsâ€”a false doorway to the backside of life, a filthy piss-ridden little hole nailed off by the building inspector, but just deep enough for a wino to curl up from the sidewalk and masturbate like a chimp in a zoo-cage."

But people grow, situations change and relationships evolve (or devolve) in one way or another; [nothing is forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_TdhhrUrv8). After a decade, and largely spurred by the pandemic, I quietly began upskilling in website design, development and administration plus a host of other digital business skills.

### ð“†” The Lurky Techno-Leech: A Snake-like Strategy to Slither & Stockpile ð“†™

As mentioned, I've long lurked GitHub and its comprehensive, seemingly endless database of repositories with encyclopedic fervour. I'm a strong supporter of this genre of communal development systems, knowledge management and open-source access, especially combined with the passionately shared responsibilities of its users and administrators. So I'm thrilled to finally hand over some personal data in exchange for participation as a full-fledged GitHubian.

I've started worked on several apps, one of which I've even started sharing in a repository here, but it's still early days for me. If I can launch one of my many ideas by the end of the year, I'll be thrilled. In the meantime, I'll be working on a digital products and services business, Damien's Digital Atelier, plus a personal knowledge management system that's really more of a digital garden.
